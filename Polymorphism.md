# Pholymorphism in C#?

### What is Pholymorphism in C#?

`Polymorphism is one of the primary pillars of object-oriented programming. It allows us to invoke derived class methods through a base class reference variable during runtime.`

`In the base class, the method is declared as virtual and in the derived class, we override the same method. The virtual keyword indicates that the method can be overridden in any derived class.`

`The word Polymorphism is derived from the Greek word, where Poly means many and morph means faces/ behaviors. So polymorphism means the ability to take more than one form.`

`The same function/ operator will show different behaviors when passed different types of values or the different number of values. So in the simple word we can say that behaving in different ways depending upon the input received is known as polymorphism i.e. whenever the input changes automatically the output or the behavior also changes.`

### What is polymorphism C# example?
`Dynamic / runtime polymorphism is also known as late binding. Here, the method name and the method signature (number of parameters and parameter type must be the same and may have a different implementation). Method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism. Method overriding can be done using inheritance.`

### What types of Pholymorphism available in c#?

**There are two type of pholymorphism :**
- Static polymorphism (Compile time polymorphism)
- Daynamic polymorphism (Run time polymorphism)

### How many approach in implemention Pholymorphism in a application ?
- Overloading
- Overriding
- Hiding

**Overloading is  three types**
- Method Overloading.
- Operator Overloading.
- Constructor Overloading.
