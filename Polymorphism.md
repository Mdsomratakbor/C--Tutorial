# Pholymorphism in C#?

### What is Pholymorphism in C#?

`Polymorphism, in C#, is the ability of objects of different types to provide a unique interface for different implementations of methods. It is usually used in the context of late binding, where the behavior of an object to respond to a call to its method members is determined based on object type at run time.`

### What is polymorphism C# example?
`Dynamic / runtime polymorphism is also known as late binding. Here, the method name and the method signature (number of parameters and parameter type must be the same and may have a different implementation). Method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism. Method overriding can be done using inheritance.`

### What types of Pholymorphism available in c#?

**There are two type of pholymorphism :**
- 1. Static polymorphism (Compile time polymorphism)
- 2. Daynamic polymorphism (Run time polymorphism)
