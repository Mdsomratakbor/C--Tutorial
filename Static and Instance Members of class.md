# STATIC AND INSTANCE MEMBERS OF CLASS IN C#

### Instance Member :
- Instance member have a separate for each and every object of the class.
- Instance member belongs to the objects of the class.
- When no static keyword is present the class member is called non-static or instance member.
- Instance or non-static members are invoked using objects of the class.

### Static Member :
- Static member belongs to the class.
- We can define class members as static using the static keyword.
- When we declare a member of a class as static, it means no matter how many objects of the class are created, there is only one copy of the static member.
- Static variables are used for defining constants because their values can be retrieved by invoking the class without creating an instance of it.
- Static Variables can be initialized outside the member function or class definition.
- You can also initialize static variables inside the class definition.
- You can also declare a member funtion as static.
- Such functions can access only static variables.
- Static member are invoked using class name.

**Note : class members can be fields, methods, properties, events, indexers, constructors.**
