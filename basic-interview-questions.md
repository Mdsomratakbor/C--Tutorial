---

### **Inheritance and Access Control in C#**

**141. How do you inherit from a class in C#?**  
You use the colon `:` syntax.  
```csharp
class BaseClass { }
class DerivedClass : BaseClass { }
```

**142. Does C# support multiple inheritance?**  
No, C# does not support multiple inheritance for classes directly. However, it supports multiple interfaces, allowing a class to implement more than one interface.

**143. When you inherit a protected class-level variable, who is it available to?**  
Protected variables are available to the derived class and any further subclasses but not outside the inheritance hierarchy.

**144. Are private class-level variables inherited?**

**145. Describe the accessibility modifier `protected internal`.**

---

### **Constructors and Inheritance**

**146. How many constructors should I write if I want both parameterless and parameterized constructors?**  
You should explicitly write two constructors:  
```csharp
public MyClass() { }  // Default constructor  
public MyClass(string param) { }  // Parameterized constructor  
```

**147. What’s the top .NET class that everything is derived from?**  
`System.Object` is the base class from which all .NET types inherit.

---

### **Method Modifiers and Overriding**

**148. What does the keyword `virtual` mean in a method definition?**  
`virtual` means the method can be overridden in a derived class. It provides polymorphism.  
```csharp
public virtual void Display() { }
```

**149. Can you declare the override method static while the original method is non-static?**  
No, the `override` method must have the same signature as the base method, including static/non-static status.

**150. Can you override private virtual methods?**  
No, private methods cannot be accessed by derived classes, so they cannot be overridden.

---

### **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**

**151. When do you absolutely have to declare a class as abstract?**  
When it includes abstract methods (methods without implementation) or if you want to prevent direct instantiation of the class. Abstract classes provide a template for derived classes.

**152. Why can’t you specify the accessibility modifier for methods inside an interface?**  
Interface methods are implicitly public and abstract. Specifying an accessibility modifier would contradict the purpose of interfaces.

**153. What if two interfaces have conflicting method names?**  
You can implement explicit interface methods to resolve conflicts.  
```csharp
interface IA { void Display(); }
interface IB { void Display(); }

class MyClass : IA, IB {
    void IA.Display() { /* IA version */ }
    void IB.Display() { /* IB version */ }
}
```

---

### **Constructors in Inheritance**

Yes, by using the `base` keyword.  
```csharp
public Derived(int x) : base(x) { }
```

---

### **Namespaces, Data Types, and Utility Methods**

**155. Is it `namespace class` or `class namespace`?**  
It is `namespace class`. You define classes inside a namespace.

**156. Difference between `ToString()` and `Convert.ToString()`?**  
- `ToString()` can throw a `NullReferenceException` if the object is null.  
- `Convert.ToString()` returns an empty string for null objects.

**157. Difference between `int.Parse()` and `Convert.ToInt32()`?**  
- `int.Parse()` throws an exception for null input.  
- `Convert.ToInt32()` returns 0 for null input.

---

### **Checked and Unchecked Blocks**

**158. What is a checked block and unchecked block?**  
- `checked` ensures that overflow exceptions are thrown.  
- `unchecked` ignores overflow exceptions.

---

### **Data Type and Memory**

**159. Program to get the range of `Byte` datatype:**  
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Range: {byte.MinValue} to {byte.MaxValue}");
```

**160. Difference between `typeof()` and `sizeof()`?**  
- `typeof()` returns the `Type` object.  
- `sizeof()` returns the size in bytes of a value type.

---

### **Type Casting**

**161. What is widening and narrowing?**  
- Widening: Converting a smaller type to a larger type (e.g., `int` to `long`).  
- Narrowing: Converting a larger type to a smaller type, which may cause data loss (e.g., `double` to `int`).

---

### **Assemblies and Reflection**

**162. How to view an Assembly?**  
Use tools like ILDASM or Reflector.

**163. How to implement Reflection in .NET?**  
```csharp
Assembly asm = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
Type t = asm.GetType("MyNamespace.MyClass");
```

---

### **Multilingual Applications and Comparisons**

**164. What are multilingual applications?**  
Applications that support multiple languages by using resource files and localization techniques.

**165. Difference between `=` and `==`:**  
- `=` is an assignment operator.  
- `==` is a comparison operator.

---

### **Collections and Constructors**

**166. What is the use of code snippets?**  
They speed up coding by inserting commonly used code structures.

**167. Difference between Arrays and Collections?**  
Arrays have fixed size, while collections (like `List`) are dynamic.

**168. Default access modifier for class members?**  
`private`.

---

### **Static and Default Constructors**

**169. Use of a constructor?**  
Initializes an object’s state.

**170. When is the static constructor called?**  
Before any instance or static members are accessed.

**171. Can static constructors be public?**  
No, static constructors cannot have access modifiers.

**172. Main() vs static constructor execution:**  
Static constructors run before `Main()`.

---

### **Accessing Constructors**
