**1. What is Computer programming?**  
Computer programming is the process of writing, testing, and maintaining code that instructs a computer to perform specific tasks.

**2. How does programming work?**  
Programming works by creating instructions (code) that a computer can execute to perform specific functions, using programming languages.

**3. What is debugging?**  
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program's code.

**4. Name different types of errors which can occur during the execution of a program.**  
Syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.

**5. When does a syntax error occur?**  
A syntax error occurs when code violates the rules of the programming language (e.g., missing semicolons, incorrect keywords).

**6. When does a runtime error occur?**  
A runtime error occurs during program execution (e.g., division by zero, accessing invalid memory).

**7. When does a logical error occur?**  
A logical error occurs when the program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic.

**8. What is a flowchart?**  
A flowchart is a diagram that visually represents the steps of an algorithm or process.

**9. What is an algorithm?**  
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task.

**10. What does 'Maintain and update the Program' mean?**  
It involves improving, modifying, and fixing a program after its initial development to ensure it continues to function correctly.

**11. What are variables?**  
Variables are named storage locations in memory that hold data values.

**12. What are reserved words?**  
Reserved words (or keywords) are predefined words in a programming language that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.

**13. What is a loop?**  
A loop is a control structure that repeats a block of code multiple times based on a condition.

**14. What is the use of the FOR…NEXT loop?**  
It repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

**15. What is the use of the WHILE…WEND loop?**  
It repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

**16. What is the use of a nested loop?**  
A nested loop is a loop within another loop, used for complex iterations.

**17. What is documentation?**  
Documentation refers to written descriptions of how a program works, including code comments and user manuals.

**18. How does a compiler work?**  
A compiler translates source code into machine code or intermediate code that a computer can execute.

**19. What do we call the binary form of a target language?**  
Object code or machine code.

**20. What are constants?**  
Constants are fixed values in a program that do not change during execution.

**21. Define numeric constants.**  
Numeric constants are fixed numbers, such as 42 or 3.14.

**22. Define string constants.**  
String constants are sequences of characters, enclosed in quotes (e.g., `"Hello"`).

**23. Define operators.**  
Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables or values (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`).

**24. What is an array?**  
An array is a data structure that stores multiple values of the same type in a single variable.

**25. What is a subroutine?**  
A subroutine is a set of instructions within a program, often called a function or procedure, that can be reused.

**26. What is the purpose of arithmetic operators?**  
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction).

**27. What is the purpose of relational operators?**  
Relational operators compare values and return true or false (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<`).

**28. Define a low-level programming language.**  
A low-level language is closer to machine code, like Assembly, providing little abstraction from hardware.

**29. Define a high-level programming language.**  
A high-level language is more abstract, easier to read, and closer to human language (e.g., Python, C#).

**30. What is machine code?**  
Machine code is binary code that a computer’s processor directly executes.

**31. List some programming languages.**  
Python, Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, Ruby, Swift.

**32. What is reliability?**  
Reliability refers to the ability of software to perform consistently under specified conditions.

**33. What is a modeling language?**  
A modeling language is used to create abstract representations (models) of systems (e.g., UML).

**34. Name some modeling languages.**  
UML, SysML, BPMN, ER diagrams.

**35. What is software testing?**  
Software testing involves evaluating software to ensure it meets requirements and is bug-free.

**36. What is a beta version?**  
A beta version is a pre-release version of software used for testing by a limited audience.

**37. How do logical operators work?**  
Logical operators perform Boolean operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).

**38. What is the purpose of the assignment operator?**  
It assigns a value to a variable (e.g., `x = 5`).

**39. What is analyzing a program?**  
Analyzing a program involves reviewing its code, structure, and performance to ensure correctness.

**40. What is the working of an algorithm?**  
An algorithm defines step-by-step instructions to solve a problem, executed sequentially or conditionally.

**41. How is division by zero defined?**  
Division by zero is undefined in mathematics and causes runtime errors in most programming languages.

**42. What is the implementation of a program?**  
Implementation is the process of writing and executing code based on design specifications.

**43. What are numeric variables?**  
Numeric variables store numerical values (e.g., integers, floats).

**44. What are string variables?**  
String variables store sequences of characters.

**45. What are commands?**  
Commands are instructions given to the computer, often in command-line environments.

**46. What are statements?**  
Statements are individual instructions in code (e.g., assignments, loops, function calls).

**47. What is the execution of a program?**  
Execution is the process of running a program so the computer performs its instructions.

**48. Define variable and constant.**  
A variable holds a value that can change, while a constant holds a fixed value.

**49. What is a data type? How many types of data types are there in .NET?**  
A data type defines the type of data a variable can hold. .NET has several data types, such as `int`, `string`, `bool`, `float`.

**50. Mention the two major categories that distinctly classify the variables of C# programs.**  
Value types (store data directly) and reference types (store references to data).
