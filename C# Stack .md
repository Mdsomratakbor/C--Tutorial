# C# Stack

### What is Stack in C#?
`The stack is a special case collection which represents a last in first out (LIFO) concept. To first understand LIFO, let's take an example. Imagine a stack of books with each book kept on top of each other.`

`The concept of last in first out in the case of books means that only the top most book can be removed from the stack of books. It is not possible to remove a book from between, because then that would disturb the setting of the stack.`

`Hence in C#, the stack also works in the same way. Elements are added to the stack, one on the top of each other. The process of adding an element to the stack is called a push operation. To remove an element from a stack, you can also remove the top most element of the stack. This operation is known as pop.`

`Let's look at the operations available for the Stack collection in more detail.`
