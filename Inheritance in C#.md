# INHERITANCE IN C# PROGRAMMING

### What is Inheritance?
`Acquiring (taking) the properties of one class into another class is called inheritance. Inheritance provides reusability by allowing us to extend an existing class.`

 `The reason behind OOP programming is to promote the reusability of code and to reduce complexity in code and it is possible by using inheritance.`
 
 `The following are the types of inheritance in C#.`

`The inheritance concept is based on a base class and derived class. Let us see the definition of a base and derived class.`
- Base class - is the class from which features are to be inherited into another class.
- Derived class - it is the class in which the base class features are inherited.

### Single inheritance 

`It is the type of inheritance in which there is one base class and one derived class.`

### Hierarchical inheritance

`This is the type of inheritance in which there are multiple classes derived from one base class. This type of inheritance is used when there is a requirement of one class feature that is needed in multiple classes.`

### Multilevel inheritance
`When one class is derived from another derived class then this type of inheritance is called multilevel inheritance.`
