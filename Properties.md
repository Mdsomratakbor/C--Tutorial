# Properties in C#

### What is Properties in c#?
`A property in C# is a member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism for classes to expose private fields. Internally, C# properties are special methods called accessors. A C# property have two accessors, get property accessor and set property accessor. A get accessor returns a property value, and a set accessor assigns a new value. The value keyword represents the value of a property.`

`Properties in C# and .NET have various access levels that is defined by an access modifier. Properties can be read-write, read-only, or write-only. The read-write property implements both, a get and a set accessor. A write-only property implements a set accessor, but no get accessor. A read-only property implements a get accessor, but no set accessor.`
