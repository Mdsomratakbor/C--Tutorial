# Properties in C#

### What is Properties in c#?
`Properties enable a class to expose a public way of getting and setting values, while hiding implementation or verification code. A get property accessor is used to return the property value, and a set property accessor is used to assign a new value. These accessors can have different access levels`

### What is the difference between field and property in C#?
`A field is a variable that is declared directly in a class or struct. ... A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Properties can be used as if they are public data members, but they are actually special methods called accessors.`
