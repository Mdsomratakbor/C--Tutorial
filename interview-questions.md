162. **What is the difference between ‘abstract’ class and ‘interface’ in C#?**
   - An **abstract class** can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and methods with implementation, whereas an **interface** can only have method signatures and cannot contain any implementation.

163. **What is the ‘in’ keyword in C#?**
   - The `in` keyword is used in method parameters to indicate that the argument will be passed by reference but is read-only (it cannot be modified within the method).

164. **What is a ‘lock’ in multithreading in C#?**
   - A **lock** is a synchronization mechanism used to ensure that only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time, preventing race conditions.

165. **What is the purpose of the ‘volatile’ keyword in C#?**
   - The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a field can be modified by multiple threads, and the compiler should not optimize the access to this field, ensuring that the most up-to-date value is always used.

166. **What is a ‘constructor’ in C#?**
   - A **constructor** is a special method in a class that is invoked when an object of that class is created. It initializes the object’s state.

167. **What is a ‘destructor’ in C#?**
   - A **destructor** is a special method in a class that is called when the object is being garbage collected. It is used to release unmanaged resources.

168. **What is the difference between ‘try-catch’ and ‘try-finally’ in C#?**
   - **Try-catch** is used for handling exceptions, allowing you to catch and handle errors. **Try-finally** ensures that the code inside the `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown.

169. **What is the ‘new’ keyword in C#?**
   - The `new` keyword is used for creating new instances of objects. It can also be used to hide a base class member (method, property, etc.) in a derived class.

170. **What is the purpose of the ‘static constructor’ in C#?**
   - A **static constructor** is used to initialize static members of a class and is called once, before any instance of the class is created or any static members are accessed.

171. **What is ‘reflection’ in C#?**
   - **Reflection** is the ability to inspect the metadata of types at runtime, allowing you to discover information about the type, its members, and its attributes.

172. **What is the ‘is’ keyword in C#?**
   - The `is` keyword is used to check if an object is of a specific type. It returns `true` if the object is of the specified type or can be cast to it.

173. **What is the ‘checked’ keyword in C#?**
   - The `checked` keyword is used to enable overflow checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.

174. **What is the ‘unchecked’ keyword in C#?**
   - The `unchecked` keyword is used to disable overflow checking for arithmetic operations and conversions.

175. **What is ‘LINQ’ in C#?**
   - **LINQ** (Language Integrated Query) is a set of methods in C# that allows you to query collections of data in a declarative way, using syntax that resembles SQL queries.

176. **What is ‘nullable’ type in C#?**
   - A **nullable** type is a type that can represent all values of its underlying type, plus `null`. It is defined using a question mark, like `int?`.

177. **What is the ‘nameof’ operator in C#?**
   - The `nameof` operator is used to get the string name of a variable, type, or member at compile time.

178. **What is the ‘var’ keyword in C#?**
   - The `var` keyword is used for implicit typing. The compiler determines the type based on the assigned value.

179. **What is the purpose of the ‘async’ and ‘await’ keywords in C#?**
   - `async` is used to define an asynchronous method, and `await` is used to pause the execution of the method until the awaited task completes.

180. **What is the difference between ‘Thread.Sleep’ and ‘Task.Delay’ in C#?**
   - **Thread.Sleep** pauses the current thread for a specified time, while **Task.Delay** asynchronously pauses a task without blocking the thread.
Here are additional C# questions and answers:

181. **What is the difference between `StringBuilder` and `String` in C#?**
   - **String** is immutable, meaning once it is created, it cannot be changed. **StringBuilder**, on the other hand, is mutable, and its value can be modified without creating a new object, which is more efficient for string manipulation in performance-critical applications.

182. **What are extension methods in C#?**
   - **Extension methods** allow you to add new functionality to existing types without modifying their source code. They are defined in static classes and use the `this` keyword to specify the type being extended.

183. **What is the `async` and `await` pattern in C#?**
   - **`async`** is used to define an asynchronous method, and **`await`** is used inside the async method to pause execution until the awaited task is completed. This pattern enables non-blocking asynchronous programming.

184. **What is the difference between `ref` and `out` in C#?**
   - Both **`ref`** and **`out`** pass parameters by reference, but with **`ref`**, the variable must be initialized before being passed, whereas with **`out`**, the variable does not need to be initialized and must be assigned a value within the method.

185. **What is an ‘indexer’ in C#?**
   - An **indexer** allows objects of a class to be indexed in a similar way to arrays. It provides a way to access elements in an object by using square brackets, e.g., `myObject[0]`.

186. **What is `IEnumerable` in C#?**
   - **`IEnumerable`** is an interface that defines a method for iterating over a collection. It provides a `GetEnumerator()` method to retrieve an enumerator that allows iteration over the collection.

187. **What is a ‘sealed’ class in C#?**
   - A **sealed** class cannot be inherited from. If a class is marked as `sealed`, no class can derive from it.

188. **What is the ‘override’ keyword in C#?**
   - The **`override`** keyword is used to provide a new implementation for a method or property defined in a base class. It must be applied to a method or property that is already marked as `virtual`, `abstract`, or `override`.

189. **What is the difference between `virtual`, `abstract`, and `override` methods in C#?**
   - A **`virtual`** method provides a base implementation that can be overridden. An **`abstract`** method does not have an implementation in the base class and must be implemented by derived classes. An **`override`** method provides a new implementation in a derived class for a method defined as `virtual` or `abstract` in the base class.

190. **What is `boxing` and `unboxing` in C#?**
   - **Boxing** is the process of converting a value type (e.g., `int`) to an object type. **Unboxing** is the reverse process, converting an object type back to a value type.

191. **What is a ‘value type’ in C#?**
   - **Value types** hold the actual data and are stored on the stack. Examples include `int`, `float`, and `struct`.

192. **What is a ‘reference type’ in C#?**
   - **Reference types** store references to the data (memory address) on the heap. Examples include `class`, `array`, and `delegate`.

193. **What is ‘dependency injection’ in C#?**
   - **Dependency injection** is a design pattern used to remove the hard-coded dependencies between classes. It allows objects to be injected into classes, making the system more modular and testable.

194. **What are `attributes` in C#?**
   - **Attributes** are metadata that can be applied to classes, methods, properties, and other elements in C#. They provide additional information that can be accessed via reflection at runtime.

195. **What is the difference between `Task` and `Thread` in C#?**
   - A **`Thread`** represents a low-level operating system thread. A **`Task`** represents an asynchronous operation and is used for higher-level concurrency control. `Task` is built on top of `Thread` and is preferred for parallel programming in C#.

196. **What is ‘dependency inversion principle’ in C#?**
   - The **dependency inversion principle** is a design principle where high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes the use of interfaces or abstract classes to decouple components.

197. **What is the difference between `String` and `StringBuilder` in C#?**
   - **`String`** is immutable, meaning any change to a string creates a new object, whereas **`StringBuilder`** is mutable and designed for situations where a string changes frequently.

198. **What is the `continue` keyword in C#?**
   - The **`continue`** keyword is used inside loops to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration of the loop.

199. **What is the `break` keyword in C#?**
   - The **`break`** keyword is used to exit a loop or a `switch` statement prematurely.

200. **What is a ‘constructor chaining’ in C#?**
   - **Constructor chaining** occurs when one constructor calls another constructor within the same class or base class. This is achieved using `this()` to call another constructor in the same class or `base()` to call a constructor from the base class.

201. **What is `ThreadPool` in C#?**
   - The **`ThreadPool`** provides a pool of threads that can be used to execute tasks asynchronously. It helps to manage thread creation overhead and can improve performance for parallel tasks.

202. **What is the ‘is null’ check in C#?**
   - The **`is null`** check is a shorthand for checking if a reference variable is null, e.g., `if (obj is null)`.

203. **What is a ‘hash table’ in C#?**
   - A **hash table** is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute the index where the value should be stored. In C#, it is implemented as `Hashtable` in the `System.Collections` namespace.

204. **What is the ‘default’ keyword in C#?**
   - The **`default`** keyword is used to return the default value of a type, e.g., `default(int)` returns `0`, and `default(bool)` returns `false`.

205. **What is the ‘params’ keyword in C#?**
   - The **`params`** keyword allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a method, typically used for methods that accept arrays of a particular type.

206. **What is ‘deep copy’ and ‘shallow copy’ in C#?**
   - A **shallow copy** copies the references of objects, while a **deep copy** copies the objects themselves, creating independent copies.

207. **What is the ‘try-catch-finally’ block in C#?**
   - A **`try-catch-finally`** block is used for exception handling. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the `try` block, errors are handled in the `catch` block, and code that runs regardless of whether an exception occurred is placed in the `finally` block.

208. **What is the ‘async’ keyword used for?**
   - The **`async`** keyword is used to define a method that performs asynchronous operations. It allows the method to execute asynchronously, improving responsiveness.

209. **What is the difference between `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerator` in C#?**
   - **`IEnumerable`** provides the ability to iterate over a collection, while **`IEnumerator`** provides the actual mechanism for the iteration process.

210. **What is the purpose of `Dispose` in C#?**
   - The **`Dispose`** method is used to release unmanaged resources, such as file handles, database connections, and memory. It is part of the `IDisposable` interface and helps ensure proper cleanup.
