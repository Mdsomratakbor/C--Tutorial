### Explain what are classes and objects in C#?

` C# is an object-oriented language and classes are its foundation. A class generally depicts the structure of data, how data is stored and managed within a program. A class has its own properties, methods, and other objects that define the class.`

`Objects are the real-world entity having some characteristics and is created using the class instance. These classes define the type of the defined object.`

`For example, if we consider a program that covers the object related to the book. We call the class a Book which has two properties: name and the author. In real programming, Vedas is an object and an instance of the class Book.`



### What difference between Convert.toString and .toString() method?

`Here both the methods are used to convert the string but the basic difference between them is: "Convert" function handles NULLS, while "i.ToString()" does not it will throw a NULL reference exception error. So as good coding practice using "convert" is always safe.`
