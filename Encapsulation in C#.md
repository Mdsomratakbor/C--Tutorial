### What is Encapsulation in C#?

- Encapsulation is the procedure of the encapsulating data and functions into a single unit (called class).
- In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods or properties of their current class. Therefore, it is also Known as data hiding.
