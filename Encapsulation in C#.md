# ENCAPSULATION IN C#

### What is Encapsulation in C#?
- Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.]
- Encapsulation is the procedure of the encapsulating data and functions into a single unit (called class).
- In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods or properties of their current class. Therefore, it is also Known as data hiding.

### Why do we need encapsulation?
`TThe need of encapsulation is to protect or prevent the code (data) from accidental corruption due to the silly little errors that we are all prone to make. In Object oriented programming data is treated as a critical element in the program development and data is packed closely to the functions that operate on it and protects it from accidental modification from outside functions.`
`Encapsulation provides a way to protect data from accidental corruption. Rather than defining the data in the form of public, we can declare those fields as private. The Private data are manipulated indirectly by two ways. Let us see some example programs in C# to demonstrate Encapsulation by those two methods. The first method is using a pair of conventional accessor and mutator methods. Another one method is using a named property. Whatever be the method our aim is to use the data without any damage or change.`
