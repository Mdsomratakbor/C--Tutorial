# STATIC CLASS IN C#

### What is static class?
`A C# static class is a class that can't be instantiated. The sole purpose of the class is to provide blueprints of its inherited classes. A static class is created using the "static" keyword in C#. A static class can contain static members only. You canâ€˜t create an object for the static class.`
