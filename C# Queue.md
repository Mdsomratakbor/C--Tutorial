# C# Queue

### What is Queue in C#?

`The Queue is a special case collection which represents a first in first out concept. Imagine a queue of people waiting for the bus. Normally, the first person who enters the queue will be the first person to enter the bus. Similarly, the last person to enter the queue will be the last person to enter into the bus. Elements are added to the queue, one on the top of each other.`

`The process of adding an element to the queue is the enqueuer operation. To remove an element from a queue, you can use the dequeuer operation. The operation in queues is similar to stack we saw previously.`

`Let's look at the operations available for the Queue collection in more detail.`
