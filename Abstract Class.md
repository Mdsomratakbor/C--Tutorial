# ABSTRACT CLASS IN C#

###  What is Abstract class in C#?
`An abstract class is an incomplete class or special class we can't be instantiated. The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a blueprint for derived classes and set some rules what the derived classes must implement when they inherit an abstract class.`
 `We can use an abstract class as a base class and all derived classes must implement abstract definitions. An abstract method must be implemented in all non-abstract classes using the override keyword. After overriding the abstract method is in the non-Abstract class. We can derive this class in another class and again we can override the same abstract method with it.`
